The Power Consumption Analyzer tooling supports the analysis of power and energy consumption of software systems defined in PCM. 
Power distribution characteristics are defined using instances of the Power Consumption model. 
The Power Consumption model references PCM's Resource Environment Model and annotates each resource and ResourceContainer with its consumption characteristics.
